## You can find this project on gitlab: https://gitlab.com/zhanesaifi17/forest-environment.git
This project was created from scratch by me. Even though I have downloaded assets from the marketplace (because I don't know blender that well, and I don't have the time to model every single mesh that I want), I did all the work myself.
